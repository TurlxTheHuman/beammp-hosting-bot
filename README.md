# beammp-hosting-bot
This beammp server hosting bot (My V1) allow people to share host beammp servers through this bot, do I know why I made it? Nope. But It helped me learn with JSON Databases and Discord Bots.

P.S. This is the first thing that I wrote in NodeJS - improvements to the code via pull requests are encouraged. Dont Skid It, Give Me Credit At Least.

## How to Use:
This is a semi-unfinished project, if you dont know or have no intentions on learning nodejs I would recommend not using this project.
